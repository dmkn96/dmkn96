## About me :
My name is Kan Dmitriy and I am 26 years old. I currently reside in Korea. At present, I work for a company that specializes in human resources management. Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience working with people, which has helped me to develop my interpersonal skills. Additionally, my past work in the tourism industry has allowed me to gain exposure to different cultures, broaden my horizons, and develop a global perspective.

However, since a young age, I've been fascinated by computer games and have had an innate curiosity for understanding how they work. This curiosity sparked my interest in game development, which eventually led me to study programming. The more I explored the programming world, the more I became captivated by the field of artificial intelligence. Learning about AI has become a top priority for me, as I'm eager to understand how it can be applied to shape the future of technology. Ultimately, my goal is to make a meaningful contribution to this field and help shape the future of AI.

I am deeply passionate about music, and I happen to have a particular talent for playing the guitar. In fact, one of my favorite ways to spend my free time is by strumming away on my guitar. It's an activity that brings me great joy and helps me unwind.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. I'm excited to see where my journey takes me next, and I can't wait to see what the future holds.
